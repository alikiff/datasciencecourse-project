CodeBook for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera Project
========================================================================

* The original data can be found here
https://github.com/alikiff/datasciencecourse-project/tree/master/datasets
or alternativlely in my github folder here
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

* The source of the data, with some informations, how it was collected and wherefore, can be found here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

* More Informations about the experiment, the dataset and especially the variables measured can be found in the
original ReadMe-File here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alikiff/datasciencecourse-project/master/readme_data_original.txt 


* The markdown file, which explains the computational steps in R, which were needed to transform the original data
  to the final, tidy and summarized data can be found here:
 https://github.com/alikiff/datasciencecourse-project/blob/master/readme.md

* The final dataset is comma-separated and can be found here:
 https://github.com/alikiff/datasciencecourse-project/blob/master/FinalTidyAverageData.txt

 Note, that the names of the variables in the dataset are already explained through the original ReadMe-File with one important difference in meanings: In the final dataset we are observing the averages over all the observations in the original dataset. So consequently the variables, either in the original or in the final dataset, should have been renamed,
but hey, why should I then write a CodeBook :-) !?
